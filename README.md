## Overview

Collect and aggregate data, build models, and optimize them for Fanduel lineups.  We are starting with one sport at a time and with simple models and then eventually want to move on to more complex models.


## Data Order

The current plan is to start off with one sport, basketball.  We want to collect the users, gamelogs, then game data.  The data source we are using is basketball-reference.com which is has most of the standard basketball statistics but it would be nice if we can find other sources that may contain other types of information like player speed, % of time in the paint, ect.


## Models

We eventually want to build models and to be able to backtest and print out our progress and results.

Feel free to contribute to this project by starting on any of the pieces above.

## Questions

Some of the things we discussed were:
- How do we manage our risk and do we have a well defined metric? (yes to the second question, make *shhtons* of money :D).
- Can we simulate different "portfolio" of players?
- What other tools and reports can we build to monitor ourselves?
- Can we estimate the baseline lineups (categories of people)?
- How do we best allocate our time and what things do we decide to tackle?
- What happens if a player moves teams?

*note*: We could eventually have a calender to list new feeds sorted by importance based on a score generated by an algorithm.
