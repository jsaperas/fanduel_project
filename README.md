## Overview

Collect and aggregate data, build models, and optimize them for Fanduel lineups.  We are starting with one sport at a time and with simple models and then eventually want to move on to more complex models.

Some of the things we discussed were:
- How do we handle injuries?
- How do we manage our risk and do we have a well defined metric? (yes to the second question, make *shhtons* of money :D).
- Can we simulate different "portfolio" of players?
- What other tools and reports can we build to monitor ourselves?
- Can we estimate the baseline lineups (categories of people)?
