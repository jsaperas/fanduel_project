## Overview

This section will contain the scripts for the reporting.  Eventually, we want to be able to determine how our models are performing over time, how we are doing across different metrics, and across different strategies.  

For each day of playing, we want to be able to record the games we've entered, who the other player is, our lineup and theirs, our expected and actual results, and total values.

We want to be able to save this into a database or a flatfile per day that we can eventually go back over and scan.    

## Tool

We may want to consider creating an rmarkdown script to automate this reporting or we could also generate data that we can pipe into an excel file that will handle the reporting.
